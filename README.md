# Portfolio

These are the programs that I created either for school or independent projects. I will always update this repository as soon as I finish write a new program. 

Feel free to look or use as inspiration with these codes.

1. Custom C Shell: A simple shell that support three built in commands "exit", "cd", and "status". It will also support comments. This shell also support background and foreground process. This program coded using C language.

2. Encrypt Decrypt OTP: Several programs that encrypt and decrypt information using OTP like system. This program coded using C language.

3. Python Combo: A program that will create files, print out on screen file content and print the product of two random integers.
 
4. Statistic (BASH): A program using bash shell to perform statistics. It can find the average and median either for row/ column.

5. Text Adventure Game: A text adventure game program like zork. Rooms' name and the connections between them will be random to prevent boredom during the game.
